### SCS0021 - Request Validation Disabled (Configuration File)
The `validateRequest` which provides additional protection against [XSS](#SCS0029) is disabled in configuration file.
#### Risk
[XSS](#SCS0029)
#### Vulnerable Code
```xml
<system.web>
   ...
   <pages [..] validateRequest="false" [..]/>
   ...
</system.web>
```
#### Solution
Although it performs blacklisting (that is worse than whitelisting by definition) and bypasses are known. It provides a basic first line of defense for your application. Do not disable the validation:
The default value is `true`.
Or set it explicitly:
```xml
<system.web>
   ...
   <pages [..] validateRequest="true" [..]/>
   ...
</system.web>
```
