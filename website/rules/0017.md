### SCS0017 - Request Validation Disabled (Attribute)
Request validation is disabled. Request validation allows the filtering of some [XSS](#SCS0029) patterns submitted to the application.
#### Risk
[XSS](#SCS0029)
#### Vulnerable Code
```cs
public class TestController
{
    [HttpPost]
    [ValidateInput(false)]
    public ActionResult ControllerMethod(string input) {
        return f(input);
    }
}
```
#### Solution
Although it performs blacklisting (that is worse than whitelisting by definition) and bypasses are known. It provides a basic first line of defense for your application. Do not disable the validation:
```cs
public class TestController
{
    [HttpPost]
    public ActionResult ControllerMethod(string input) {
        return f(input);
    }
}
```
Always user proper encoder (Html, Url, etc.) before displaying or using user supplied data (even if it is loaded from database).
